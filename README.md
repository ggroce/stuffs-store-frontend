## ReactJS frontend for a generic web store  
WIP - Developing a fully featured React storefront, complete with user login, shopping cart, and multiple layers of components that host the collections of products.  

### Details on the tech and packages being used
* ReactJS
* Styled Components being used throughout
* React-router-dom and Redux utilized throughout
* Firebase being used for user auth and store of data, (collections of products)
* Stripe integrated for payments

#### Todo: 
- [ ] Update Stripe package/component to a newer version, possibly refactor into a new component rather than modal
- [ ] Create function to clear cart contents on Stripe transaction success
